# 🧮 Superannuation Optimisation for Emily – Monte Carlo & Solver Insights

Simulation-based analysis of a 30-year-old software engineer’s superannuation strategy, assessing whether current contributions and fund allocations are sufficient to meet retirement goals under varying salary and market return scenarios.

## 📘 Project Summary

Emily's current super strategy:
- 💰 Salary: $70,000, with 3.5% annual raises (±0.7% SD)
- 🧾 Employer match: 3% (total contribution: 6%)
- 📊 Fund allocation:  
  - 40% in **HarbourSafe Bonds (conservative)**  
  - 30% in **Horizon Balanced Fund**  
  - 30% in **SkyHigh Equity (growth)**

Her retirement goal: **$1.5 million** by age 65 to maintain her lifestyle, travel, and manage future healthcare costs.

## 🔧 What We Did

- 🧠 Ran **Monte Carlo simulations** to model salary growth and market returns
- 🛠️ Built a **portfolio optimiser** using Excel Solver (because why not)
- ⚖️ Evaluated return vs. risk using **volatility** and good ol’ logic
- 📉 Analysed low, mid, and high growth scenarios (spoiler: her current plan’s kinda shaky)

## 🔍 Key Findings

- 🎯 Current strategy only gives Emily a **13% chance** of hitting $1.5M
- 🚀 With a contribution bump to 10% (13% total) and reallocation, odds improve to **81%**
- 💡 Horizon fund is most efficient when balancing risk and return

## 📊 Tools & Techniques

- Monte Carlo Simulation (2000+ scenarios — Emily’s future got tested hard)
- A modest increase in contribution to 10% (employer match makes it 13%) boosts her odds to **81%**
- Rebalancing her fund mix — less HarbourSafe, more Horizon — improves risk-adjusted returns
- Turns out, being a bit more adventurous pays off in the long run (but not too wild!

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project was created as part of our **Master of Business Analytics** at the University of Auckland. It’s **not financial advice**, but if Emily takes the recommendations, I would probably sleep better at night.
